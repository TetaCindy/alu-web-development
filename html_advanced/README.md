# HTML Advanced Project â€” Headphone Company

## Overview
This project is part of the Frontend Web Development course at ALU.  
The task is to recreate a webpage from a given Figma design using pure semantic HTML only.  
No CSS, no styling, and no external frameworks are included. The focus is on HTML structure and semantics.

## What the Project Demonstrates
Ability to read and interpret a Figma design file.  
Proper use of semantic HTML elements such as header, nav, main, section, article, figure, and footer.  
Accessibility awareness by providing descriptive alt attributes for images.  
Building a logical content structure that matches the design.

## Project Structure
html_advanced/  
index.html        Semantic HTML implementation of the Figma mockup  
README.md         Project documentation (this file)  
assets/  
   images/        Exported images and icons from Figma  

## How to View
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.  
2. Open html_advanced/index.html in any modern browser.  
3. The page will display the structure of the mockup without styles.

## Notes
Fonts in the Figma file include Source Sans Pro and Spin-Cycle-OT. Since no CSS is allowed, font styling is not implemented here.  
All exported images from Figma are stored in the assets/images/ directory.  
Some measurements in the design were rounded for simplicity.
